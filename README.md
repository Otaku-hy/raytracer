# raytracer

This program is a raytracer, whichs simulate pathtracing algorithm.

The origin version(v1.0) is available on shadering the phong model for spheres. 

The version(v1.1) completes a lambertain diffuse rendering method. Also the area light includes into the algorithm and the Camera.h and Utils.h are added in the project so that the raytracer now can deal with camera in different location and look at different points.
